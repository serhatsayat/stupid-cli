# T02: Create ANTHROPIC_API_KEY-gated end-to-end integration test

**Slice:** S06 — End-to-End Integration & Real API Test
**Milestone:** M002

## Description

R033 requires proof that `stupid "add a hello world function"` executes the full pipeline with real Anthropic API calls — not mocks — and produces a valid plan. This is the milestone's final acceptance evidence.

This task creates a single test file `packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts` that:
- Skips gracefully when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set (D038)
- Creates a temporary git repo with initial commit (following the `worktree-manager-integration.test.ts` pattern)
- Builds a real `StupidConfig` + `OrchestratorContext` with all S01-S05 modules wired
- Runs `Orchestrator.run("add a hello world function")` with real API
- Asserts on plan structure: ≥1 slice, slices have tasks, agent outputs are non-empty
- Runs `Doctor.check()` on post-run state and asserts it passes
- Cleans up temp directory

The test imports modules directly (not via the barrel `index.ts`) to avoid mock interference from other test files that use `vi.mock`.

## Steps

1. **Create `packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts`**. Use `describe.skipIf(!process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)` to gate the entire suite on the API key. Set up temp directory management with `afterEach` cleanup.

2. **Set up temp git repo helper**. Follow the exact pattern from `packages/core/src/__tests__/worktree-manager-integration.test.ts`: `mkdtempSync`, `git init -b main`, configure user.name/email, create README.md, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "initial commit"`. Also create a `.stupid/` directory and a minimal source file (e.g. `src/index.ts` with a comment) so agents have something to read.

3. **Write the main integration test**. Import concrete classes directly: `Orchestrator` from `../orchestrator/orchestrator.js`, `ComplexityClassifier` from `../orchestrator/complexity-classifier.js`, `RoutingHistory` from `../orchestrator/routing-history.js`, `CostTracker` from `../governance/cost-tracker.js`, `BudgetEnforcer` from `../governance/budget-enforcer.js`, `FileSelector` from `../context/file-selector.js`, `Doctor` from `../infrastructure/doctor.js`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG` from `../config/config.js`. Build config with `{ ...DEFAULT_CONFIG, profile: "budget", projectRoot: tempDir }` (budget profile = cheapest/fastest, skips architect phase). Wire full OrchestratorContext. Call `orchestrator.run("add a hello world function")` with `180_000` ms timeout. Assert: `plan.slices.length >= 1`, `plan.slices[0].tasks.length >= 1`, plan has milestone with non-empty title.

4. **Write Doctor health check test**. After the orchestrator run, create a `Doctor` instance with the temp projectRoot and call `doctor.check()`. Assert `report.passed === true` or at minimum that no checks have `status: "fail"`. This verifies state directory integrity after a real pipeline execution.

## Must-Haves

- [ ] Test file exists at `packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Test suite skips when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set
- [ ] Test creates a temp git repo, runs Orchestrator.run() with real API, asserts plan structure
- [ ] Doctor.check() is exercised and asserts no failures
- [ ] Test cleans up temp directory in afterEach
- [ ] Test uses 180s timeout for real API calls
- [ ] All existing 511 tests still pass (test file doesn't interfere)
- [ ] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is never logged or echoed in test output

## Verification

- `npx vitest run packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts` — skips with "no tests" or "skipped" when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is unset
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<real-key> npx vitest run packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts` — passes with real API (when key available)
- `npx vitest run` — full suite still 511+ tests, no regressions
- `npm run build && npm run typecheck` — clean

## Inputs

- `packages/core/src/__tests__/worktree-manager-integration.test.ts` — pattern for temp git repo setup/cleanup
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts` — Orchestrator class (wired in T01)
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/interfaces.ts` — OrchestratorContext type
- `packages/core/src/infrastructure/doctor.ts` — Doctor class
- `packages/core/src/config/config.ts` — DEFAULT_CONFIG
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/complexity-classifier.ts` — ComplexityClassifier class
- `packages/core/src/orchestrator/routing-history.ts` — RoutingHistory class
- `packages/core/src/governance/cost-tracker.ts` — CostTracker class
- `packages/core/src/governance/budget-enforcer.ts` — BudgetEnforcer class
- `packages/core/src/context/file-selector.ts` — FileSelector class
- `packages/cli/src/context.ts` — reference for how buildContext wires everything (modified in T01)

## Expected Output

- `packages/core/src/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts` — new file: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY-gated integration test proving full pipeline with real API
